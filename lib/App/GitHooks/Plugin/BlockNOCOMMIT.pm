=head1 NAME

App::GitHooks::Plugin::BlockNOCOMMIT - Prevent committing code with #NOCOMMIT mentions.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you want to experiment with code, but you want to make sure that test
code doesn't get committed by accident.

This plugin allows you to use C<#NOCOMMIT> to indicate such code blocks, and
will prevent you from committing those blocks.

For example:

	# This is a test that will not work once deployed.
	# NOCOMMIT
	...

Note that the following variations on the tag are correctly picked up:

=over 4

=item * C<#NOCOMMIT>

=item * C<# NOCOMMIT>

=item * C<# NO COMMIT>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_file_pattern()

Return a pattern to filter the files this plugin should analyze.

}


=head2 get_file_check_description()

Return a description of the check performed on files by the plugin and that
will be displayed to the user, if applicable, along with an indication of the
success or failure of the plugin.
